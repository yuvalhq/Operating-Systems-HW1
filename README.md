# Operating-Systems-HW1
Multi-Level Page Tables Assignment:
In this assignment, the objective was to develop a simulated operating system code capable of managing a multi-level page table using a trie-based data structure. This implementation aimed to reinforce the concepts learned in class while maintaining code quality and conciseness.

The files os.h and os.c were provided as they were, without any allowance for modifications.
